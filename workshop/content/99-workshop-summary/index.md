title: Workshop Summary
---

In this workshop, we explored the capabilities of **Spring AI**, a powerful library design to help you
streamline the development of applications that incorporate artificial intelligence functionality without
unnecessary complexity.

We explored a simple **ChatClient** with various prompts, user prompts, and system prompts.
We looked at the embedding models and how to represent data in **VectorStore** to stuff the prompt.
We played with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** or **RAG** pattern.

The area of AI design patterns is an area of active research. 

Keep reading and exploring **Spring AI** topics further at
[Spring AI Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html).
